# Expense Management System

# Overview
This Expense Management System is a DBMS Mini Project that uses EJS, NodeJS, and MySQL to manage the expenses for a set of users under an admin.

# Features
- Admin can add and delete multiple users, whose expenses can then be monitored, individually.
- Every user can add a maximum of three accounts to make transactions, which will be uniquely identified by their account numbers.
- A user can add money to their respective accounts, too.
- A common rewards page can then be used by users under a single admin, and once claimed by one of the users, cannot be claimed by a different user.
- The rewards claimed by a user can also be seen on their rewards page.
- A new admin can only be added by another admin, but only the admin adding the various user accounts can see the users that they added.
